# Solar Insight Project
Overview:

Solar Insight leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to enhance the forecasting accuracy of solar photovoltaic (PV) power outputs and introduces a peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading platform. This project aims to optimize residential solar energy management and promote the adoption of distributed renewable energy resources. 

Features:

Predictive Modeling: Implements Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Linear Regression models to predict solar energy outputs based on weather conditions.
Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading: Facilitates direct electricity trading among users, enhancing the energy economy within communities.
User Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface designed for easy navigation and interaction, enhancing user engagement.

Technologies used are Machine Learning(Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow) and for Data Handlin(Pandas, NumPy).
